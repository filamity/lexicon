# Lexicon JP

A website to help Japanese langauge learners to remember vocabulary (in desperate preparation the night before the exam).

[Currently deployed](https://lexiconjp.web.app/) with Firebase.

## Features

The aim was to make the vocabulary practicing fast-paced and with minimum clicking, scrolling etc.
Here are the current features:

 - Authentication to save your progress;
 - Ability to add difficult words to a list which can be downloaded as a .txt file;
 - Ability to answer in either Kana or Romaji.
